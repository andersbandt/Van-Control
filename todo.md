### front-end


1. [x] add slider to temperature page to adjust time duration.
   - [ ] make the slider more intuitive (report in number of days)
   - [ ] have the display be better of what value we are on

   - [ ] with data in both C and F
   - [ ] add multiple sensors

3. [ ] fix the ticks on the graph. Have them be more readable and less of them


4. [ ] add some "day" view, where I can toggle to view day by day or week by week

5. [x] strip out outliers in the graph view, maybe even don't even log them?


### back-end (data anlalysis)
