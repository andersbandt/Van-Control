## to do items


1. add slider to temperature page to adjust time duration.
   - like 1 day behind? 6 hours behind? 3 days behind?


2. random long term thinking
   - add some "export data from time period" option
   - testware for my van build!!!!



3. add some statistics table with data in both C and F
   and other things like recent lows and highs over a certain day period
